# Documentation Update: Auto-Documentation Agent (`autoDocAgent.js`)

The `autoDocAgent.js` script has been significantly refactored to improve robustness, enhance user feedback, and streamline its execution. The core functionality of generating documentation from a git diff remains, but its implementation has been modernized.

### Summary of Changes

The agent now uses the native `child_process.execSync` to run Git commands directly, removing the `simple-git` dependency. Configuration has been clarified, error handling has been improved, and the script now provides more verbose logging throughout its execution. The output path and commit message have also been updated.

### Detailed Changes

#### 1. Dependency and Execution

*   **Dependency Change**: The `simple-git` library has been removed. All Git interactions are now handled by calling the system's `git` command directly using Node.js's built-in `child_process.execSync` module. This reduces dependencies and makes the agent's behavior more transparent.
*   **Self-Execution**: The script is now self-executing, with `runDocumentationAgent()` called at the end of the file.

#### 2. Configuration and AI Model

*   **API Key**: The environment variable for the API key has been renamed from `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. The script now includes a check and will exit with an error if this key is not set.
*   **AI Model**: The agent has been updated to use the `gemini-2.5-pro` model via the `v1beta` API, ensuring it uses a recent and valid model endpoint.

#### 3. Output and File Management

*   **Output Path**: Generated documentation is now saved to a dedicated `docs` directory at the path `docs/UPDATED_DOCUMENTATION.md`. Previously, it was saved to `TECHNICAL_DOC.md` in the project root.
*   **Directory Creation**: The script automatically creates the `docs/` directory if it doesn't already exist.

#### 4. Git Integration and Automation

*   **Git Commands**: All `git` operations (`add`, `commit`, `push`) are now executed via `execSync`.
*   **Commit Message**: The automated commit message has been updated to a more conventional format: `docs: update autogenerated documentation`.
*   **Git Error Handling**: The `git commit` and `push` operations are wrapped in their own `try...catch` block. This ensures that if a Git command fails (e.g., due to a push conflict), it is logged as an error without crashing the entire script.

#### 5. Logging and Error Handling

*   **Verbose Logging**: The script now provides enhanced, step-by-step console logs with emojis to indicate its progress, from starting the agent to finding changes, sending prompts, and pushing to GitHub.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The main agent logic is wrapped in a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle and report any unexpected errors during its run.
